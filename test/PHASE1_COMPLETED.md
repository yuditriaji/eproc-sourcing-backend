# Phase 1: Fix Test URLs - COMPLETED ✅

## What Was Fixed

Added `TENANT = 'test-tenant'` constant and updated all API URLs to include the tenant parameter.

### Files Modified

1. **test/bid-management.spec.ts** ✅
   - Added `const TENANT = 'test-tenant';`
   - Updated all 21 endpoint calls from `/bids`, `/tenders` to `/${TENANT}/bids`, `/${TENANT}/tenders`
   - **Status**: Ready to test! All endpoints exist.

2. **test/invoice-payment.spec.ts** ✅
   - Added `const TENANT = 'test-tenant';`
   - Updated all 30+ endpoint calls for vendors, PO, invoices, payments
   - **Status**: Partial - Vendors and PO will work. Invoices/Payments need controllers (Phase 2).

3. **test/goods-receipt.spec.ts** ✅
   - Already correct! Uses `${TENANT}` pattern.
   - No changes needed.

## What You Can Test Now

### ✅ These Will Work (Endpoints Exist)

```bash
# Bid management tests
npx jest test/bid-management.spec.ts --verbose

# Goods receipt tests  
npx jest test/goods-receipt.spec.ts --verbose
```

**Expected**: Tests should now actually create data instead of getting 404s!

### ⚠️ These Will Partially Work

```bash
# Invoice/Payment tests - vendors and PO creation will work
npx jest test/invoice-payment.spec.ts --verbose
```

**Expected**: 
- ✅ Vendor creation will work
- ✅ PO creation will work  
- ❌ Invoice creation will fail (404 - no controller)
- ❌ Payment creation will fail (404 - no controller)

---

## Verification Commands

### 1. Run Bid Tests
```bash
npx jest test/bid-management.spec.ts --verbose
```

**What to Look For**:
- No more "Skipping: No bid ID" messages
- Tests actually pass with 201/200 status codes
- Bids are created and submitted successfully

### 2. Check Database After Tests
```bash
# After running bid tests, check if bids were created
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bids;"
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT id, status, \"bidAmount\", \"submittedAt\" FROM bids ORDER BY \"createdAt\" DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

**Expected Output**:
```
 count 
-------
     3
(1 row)

                  id                  | status    | bidAmount |      submittedAt       
--------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------------------------
 clxxxx...                            | SUBMITTED |  95000.00 | 2025-10-26 14:30:00
 clxxxx...                            | SUBMITTED | 110000.00 | 2025-10-26 14:30:05
 clxxxx...                            | SUBMITTED |  48000.00 | 2025-10-26 14:30:10
```

### 3. Check Purchase Orders
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM purchase_orders;"
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT id, \"poNumber\", status, amount FROM purchase_orders ORDER BY \"createdAt\" DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

---

## What's Next: Phase 2

### Create Missing Controllers

These controllers need to be created:

1. **InvoiceController** + InvoiceService + InvoiceModule
2. **PaymentController** + PaymentService + PaymentModule
3. **QuotationController** + QuotationService + QuotationModule

Then register them in `src/app.module.ts`.

See `test/ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md` for implementation details.

## Quick Test Script

Run this to see the difference:

```bash
# Before: Tests skip, tables empty
# After: Tests run, data created!

echo "Running bid tests..."
npx jest test/bid-management.spec.ts --verbose

echo "\nChecking database..."
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
SELECT 
  'bids' as table_name, 
  COUNT(*) as count 
FROM bids
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'purchase_orders', 
  COUNT(*) 
FROM purchase_orders
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'goods_receipts', 
  COUNT(*) 
FROM goods_receipts;
"
```

Expected output:
```
 table_name       | count
------------------|-------
 bids             | 3+
 purchase_orders  | 1+
 goods_receipts   | 0 (needs PO from different test)
```

## Summary

✅ **Fixed**: Bid and Tender endpoints - now using correct tenant parameter
✅ **Fixed**: Vendor and PO endpoints - now using correct tenant parameter  
⏳ **Pending**: Invoice, Payment, Quotation controllers need to be created

**Immediate Benefit**: You can now successfully test Bid, Tender, Vendor, and PO workflows!

**Next Step**: Create Invoice, Payment, and Quotation controllers to complete the fix.
